#### The template was created so we can start the project faster. Unifying all the logic of the redux, in a single file like in duck pattern. We also have a template generator where we can create several components with only this command.

## Starting project with this template

You can starting a new project this way:

`expo init MyAppName --template react-native-template-vindicce-context`

## Generator Options

run `yarn g` to see the options

- `Function View`: • View, to create Views(Container's), with redux.
- `Component`: • Components, for the creation of components.
- `Flow`: • Flow, to create a new application flow, already as a standard view, with redux.
- `Hooks`: To create a new hooks/context.

#### :exclamation: `The model will take care of creating and making all imports to leave what was created with global access.`

## import examples

All codes can be imported from the index.js of their respective folders.

```components

import React from 'react'
import { CustomButton, CustomBackground } from '../components'
...

```
